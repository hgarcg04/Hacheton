##  Overview

**Impactor-2025** is an interactive web-based simulation tool designed to visualize asteroid impact scenarios and evaluate potential consequences and mitigation strategies.  
Using **real datasets** from **NASA** and the **United States Geological Survey (USGS)**, the platform enables users to explore what could happen if an asteroid were to collide with Earth ‚Äî and how humanity could respond.

---

##  Objectives

- Empower users with **data-driven insights** on asteroid impact risks.  
- Integrate **NASA NEO** and **USGS geospatial data** for accurate simulations.  
- Visualize effects such as crater size, blast radius, and thermal radiation.  
- Support **decision-making** and **public awareness** through interactive tools.  
- Inspire innovation in **planetary defense** and **Earth resilience**.

##  Key Features

-  **Real Data Integration** ‚Äì Live connection to NASA NeoWs and CNEOS APIs.  
-  **Interactive Map Visualization** ‚Äì 2D/3D impact zones rendered using Mapbox or Cesium.  
-  **Physics-Based Simulation** ‚Äì Calculates kinetic energy, crater formation, blast wave, and thermal effects.  
-  **Population Impact Analysis** ‚Äì Combines WorldPop or GPW datasets for exposure estimation.  
-  **Mitigation Scenario Testing** ‚Äì Simulate kinetic deflection or evacuation strategies.  
-  **Decision Support Dashboard** ‚Äì Detailed analytics for emergency planners.
