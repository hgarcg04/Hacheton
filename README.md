## 🚀 Overview

**Impactor-2025** is an interactive web-based simulation tool designed to visualize asteroid impact scenarios and evaluate potential consequences and mitigation strategies.  
Using **real datasets** from **NASA** and the **United States Geological Survey (USGS)**, the platform enables users to explore what could happen if an asteroid were to collide with Earth — and how humanity could respond.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Empower users with **data-driven insights** on asteroid impact risks.  
- Integrate **NASA NEO** and **USGS geospatial data** for accurate simulations.  
- Visualize effects such as crater size, blast radius, and thermal radiation.  
- Support **decision-making** and **public awareness** through interactive tools.  
- Inspire innovation in **planetary defense** and **Earth resilience**.
